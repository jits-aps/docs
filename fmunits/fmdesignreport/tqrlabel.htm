Properties of TQRLabel

Name

Description



AlignToBand

By default components will print/align at the position set in the designer. But sometimes it is more practical to align components to the vertical edges of the band that it is placed on. When AlignToBand is True, the text component will align itself relative to its parent band instead of its own text rectangle.



Alignment

Determines where text is printed in the control - may be Left, Centre, or Right.



AutoSize

If this property is true, the control can increase its width to accommodate its text.



AutoStretch

If AutoStretch and WordWrap are both True, the component can expand vertically to accommodate its text. When the component expands in this way it also expands its parent band, provided that bandâs CanExpand property is set to True. A band can expand over multiple pages if necessary.
&nbsp;
Note that if a component expands it will not move other components on the same band down. If you have components whose desired position should depend on the length of a stretching text, you should place these in a child band. 
&nbsp;
Note also that this property cannot be used for components on any band that prints at the bottom of the page. This is typically the page footer, but also applies to any band that has had its AlignToBottom property set to True.



Caption

This is the text that will be displayed UNLESS the Lines property is set, in which case the lines are printed.



Color

Sets the background color of the label. Use the Font property to set text color etc.



Enabled

Determines whether the component appear at runtime.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text.
If not explicitly set, the control takes its font from its parent.



Frame

All text components can display a visible frame around them. This property controls the appearance of the frame, which sides it is drawn on and so on.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control.



Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



ParentFont

Determines where a control looks for its font information.



Size

All printable components share the Size property. If AutoSize is False you can use this property to set the exact size of the component. This property also contains the position of the component relative to its parent band.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Top

Specifies the Y coordinate of the top left corner of a control, relative to its parent or containing control in pixels.



Transparent

Specifies whether the controls background will be transparent, so the surface of its parent will be visible âthroughâ the control.



Width

Specifies the horizontal size of the control.
Note! This property will be ignored if AutoSize is true.



WordWrap

The WordWrap property controls how a line of text that is too long to fit in the width of the control is printed. If WordWrap is True the text will be wrapped to a new line. If the AutoStretch property is True this might make the control expand vertically. 
If WordWrap is False the text will be clipped. WordWrap is True by Default.

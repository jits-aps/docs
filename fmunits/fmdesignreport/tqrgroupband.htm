General
The QRGroupBand component is similar to a header band, except it has an associated numerical expression whose value causes the group to break. A footer band can be associated with a group control so that the group can have a header and a footer.
&nbsp;
The group expression is evaluated on every record and if it changes from the previous value, the group âbreaksâ - that is the group header is printed. Expressions may be functions of database fields, system variables, functions and constants.

Properties of TQRGroupBand
&nbsp;


Name

Description



AlignToBottom

Use AlignToBottom to force a band to print at the bottom of a page instead of at the top. QuickReport will leave room for a page footer band if such exists. If this property is True for a detail band the effect will be that only one detail band is printed per page.



Color

This sets the background color. Use the Font properties to change text color.



Enabled

Determines whether the component appear at runtime.



Expression

Expressions may be functions of database fields, system variables, functions and constants.
See Using expression for more information.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text in the band.
If this is not set it defaults to the parentâs font. The band font may be overridden by setting text control properties.



FooterBand

This property should point to a TQRBand component which has its BandType set to rbGroupFooter. This band will print when the group has finished printing.



ForceNewColumn

If true, the band will always start a new column (this will be a new page in single column reports)
Useful for making reports with many summaries more readable.



ForceNewPage

If true, the band will always start on a new page. Useful for placing summaries at the top of pages.



Frame

&lt;description missing&gt;



HasChild

Use this property to create a child band witch will be placed automatically below its parent and associated with it via the âparentâ property.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control in pixels.



KeepOnOnePage

This will stop the band breaking across a page boundary. If the band grows to be bigger than an entire page, it will break, and force this option to false.



Left

Is controlled by the report designer and has no effect.



LinkBand

Linked bands will always print together. That is, they will not be separated by page breaks. In practice, a copy of the linked band is always made before this is printed.



Master

This property should point to the TQReport component or a sub band that has an associated dataset. The group will be driven by this dataset.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



ParentFont

Determines where a control looks for its font information.



PreCalculateHeight

This is for painting the backgrounds of expanding bands. Only works if 'KeepOnOnePage' is true.



ReprintOnNewPage

If this is set to True, the band will repeat itself at the top of the next page IF it was the last group band on the previous page.



Size

This property has two options, width and height. Width is a read-only property, height may be set in code.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Top

Is controlled by the report designer and has no effect.



TransparentBand

This will suppress the printing of band backgrounds in case there is a background image on the report.



Width

Is controlled by the report designer and has no effect.

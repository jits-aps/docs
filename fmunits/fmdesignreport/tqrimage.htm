General
The TQRImage component is accessible by the Design Palette and displays images, like the standard TImage. It may be placed anywhere on a report and will display the image specified in the Picture property.
&nbsp;
The behaviour of the control a runtime is set using the AutoSize, Center and Stretch properties.
&nbsp;
Background Image
If you want to use the control as a page background image, place the control on the report areal, behind the bands. The report generator supports only one background image.

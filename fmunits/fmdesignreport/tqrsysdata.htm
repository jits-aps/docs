Properties of TQRSysData
&nbsp;


Name

Description



AlignToBand

By default components will print/align at the position set in the designer. But sometimes it is more practical to align components to the vertical edges of the band that it is placed on. When AlignToBand is True, the text component will align itself relative to its parent band instead of its own text rectangle.



Alignment

Determines where text is printed in the control - may be Left, Centre, or Right.



AutoSize

If this property is true, the control can increase its width to accommodate its text.



Color

Sets the background color of the label. Use the Font property to set text color etc.



Data

This property must be set to one of the enumerated types:

Enabled

Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text.

Frame

All text components can display a visible frame around them. This property controls the appearance of the frame, which sides it is drawn on and so on.



Height

Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



ParentFont

Determines where a control looks for its font information.



Size

All printable components share the Size property. If AutoSize is False you can use this property to set the exact size of the component. This property also contains the position of the component relative to its parent band.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Text

This text will be printed as a prefix to the data value.



Top

Specifies the Y coordinate of the top left corner of a control, relative to its parent or containing control in pixels.



Transparent

Specifies whether the controls background will be transparent, so the surface of its parent will be visible âthroughâ the control.

Specifies the horizontal size of the control.
Note! This property will be ignored if AutoSize is true.

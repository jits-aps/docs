Description
TBlobField represents a field in a dataset that holds a reference to a binary large object (BLOB).
&nbsp;
TBlobField encapsulates the fundamental behavior common to binary large object (BLOB) fields. BLOB fields are database fields that contain raw binary data of arbitrary length. BLOB fields can represent different arbitrarily large data types. These data types are distinguished in the header of the binary data.
&nbsp;
In addition to the field types supported directly, TBlobField is the direct ancestor of two BLOB field components: TMemoField and TGraphicField. These descendants represent BLOB fields that have headers peculiar to memos or graphic data, respectively.
&nbsp;
If you use the Table Designer at design time to create a persistent field component for the BLOB field, you can access it by name at runtime. When using dynamic field components, you can access the TBlobField instance using the dataset's Fields property or FieldByName method.

Properties of TField
&nbsp;


Name

Description



AsBoolean
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as a boolean value.



AsDateTime
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as a TDateTime value.



AsFloat
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as a double value.



AsInteger
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as a 32-bit integer.



AsString
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as a string.



AsVariant
Run-time only

Represents the Value of the field as a Variant.



BlobType
Run-time only

For internal use only.



DataType
Run-time only

Identifies the TFieldType of the field component.



DefaultValue

Use the DefaultValue property to access or define the default value for the field definition. The expression used
for the default value must be a simple literal constant or one of the following default SQL parameters:
CURRENT_ACCID
CURRENT_ACCNAME
CURRENT_DATABASE
CURRENT_DATE
CURRENT_STOCKID
CURRENT_TIME
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
CURRENT_USERNAME



DisplayLabel

Contains the text to display as Field Name in a data-aware controls.



DisplayText
Run-time only

Represents the field's value as it is displayed in a data-aware control.



DisplayWidth

Specifies the number of characters that should be used to calculate the column width for the field when it is displayed by TGrid.



FieldName

Indicates the name of the physical column in the underlying table or query result to which a field component is bound.



Index
Run-time only

Indicates the field component's index in the Fields property of the dataset.



IsNull
Run-time only

Indicates whether the field has a value assigned to it.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



Origin

The Origin property distinguishes the name of the field as it appears in its dataset from the name of the field in the base table on which it is based. For example, in a query that uses the following SQL statement, the value of Origin is CUSTOMERS.NO.
&nbsp;
SELECT NO AS &quot;ID&quot; FROM CUSTOMERS



ReadOnly

Determines whether the field can be modified.



Required

Specifies whether a nonblank value for a field is required.



Size

Indicates the size used in the definition of the physical database field for data types that support different sizes.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Text
Run-time only

Contains the string to display in a data-aware control when the field is in edit mode.



Value

Represents the data in the BLOB field.



Visible

Determines whether the field appears in TGrid control.




&nbsp;
Methods of TField
&nbsp;


Name

Description



Assign

Copies a value to the BLOB field. Use Assign to copy data to the BLOB field from another BLOB field or a TStringList, TPicture or TGraphic object.



Clear

Clears the current value in the BLOB field.



FocusControl

Forces a form's focus to the first data-aware component associated with the field object.



LoadFromFile

Loads BLOB data from a file into the field.



LoadFromStream

Loads BLOB data from a stream into the field.



SaveToFile

Saves the contents of the BLOB field to a file.



SaveToStream

Saves the contents of the BLOB field to a stream.




&nbsp;
Events of TField
&nbsp;


Name

Description



OnChange

Occurs immediately after the data in the field is written to the record buffer.



OnGetText

Occurs when the DisplayText or Text properties of the field are referenced.
&nbsp;
Write an OnGetText handler to perform custom processing for the DisplayText and Text properties. Use OnGetText to format the Value of the field differently when it must be edited from the format used when simply displaying the value, or use OnGetText to display something other than the field's value when it is displayed.
&nbsp;
If there is no OnGetText handler, the value of the DisplayText and Text properties is simply the value of the AsString property.



OnSetText

Occurs when the Text property is assigned a value.
&nbsp;
Write an OnSetText event handler to specify processing that occurs whenever Text receives a new value. If there is an OnGetText event handler that formats the Value of the field in some special way for editing purposes, OnSetText should reverse the process when parsing the edited string.
&nbsp;
If there is no OnSetText handler, the Text property is set by setting the AsString property.



OnValidate

Occurs just before the data is written to the record buffer.
&nbsp;
Write an OnValidate event handler to validate changes made to the data in the field, just before the data is written to the current record buffer. To reject the current value of the field from the OnValidate event handler, raise an exception by calling the ErrorMsg procedure.

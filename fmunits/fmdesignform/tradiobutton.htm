Description
Use TRadioButton to add a radio button to a form. Radio buttons present a set of mutually exclusive options to the user- that is, only one radio button in a set can be selected at a time. When the user selects a radio button, the previously selected radio button becomes unselected. 
&nbsp;
All radio buttons that are directly contained in the same windowed control container, such as a TPanel, are grouped. For example, two radio buttons on a form can be checked at the same time only if they are contained in separate containers.

General
TWebBrowser wraps the IWebBrowser2 interface from Microsoft's Shell Doc Object and Control Library (SHDOCVW.DLL) to allow you to create a customized Web browsing application or to add Internet, file and network browsing, document viewing, and data downloading capabilities to your applications. The TWebBrowser component can display any Web page that Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later (i.e. 4.0, 4.01, 5, 5.5, 6 ...) can display.
&nbsp;
Note: Because TWebBrowser wraps the SHDOCVW.DLL, you must have SHDOCVW.DLL installed to use this component. This DLL ships with Internet Explorer 4 and later.

Browser Emulation
The FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION feature defines the default emulation mode:

&nbsp;
Example:
The flowing example changes the emulation to run in IE11 mode:
&nbsp;
const
 &nbsp; ModeIE11 = 11000;
var
 &nbsp; Reg: TRegistry;
begin
 &nbsp; Reg := TRegistry.Create('software\microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION');
 &nbsp; try
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reg.WriteInteger('','Admind.exe',ModeIE11)
 &nbsp; finally
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reg.Free;
 &nbsp; end;
end;

Methods of TWebBrowser
&nbsp;


Name

Description



Busy

Indicates whether the WebBrowser control is in the middle of a navigation or downloading operation.



Refresh

Reloads the current document. 
Call Refresh to reload the current document. This is useful when the Web browser is displaying the resource at an URL that may have changed. 



GoBack

Navigates to the previous item in the history list. 
Call GoBack to return to the last document in the history list. GoBack has no effect unless the history list contains additional documents. 



GoForward

Navigates to the next item in the history list. 
Call GoForward to return to the next document in the history list. GoForward reverses the effect of the last GoBack command. 



GoHome

Navigates to the current start page. 
Call GoHome to navigate to the url called by Navigate.



Navigate

Navigates to a resource identified by a path name or URL. 
Use Navigate to locate and download a specific resource. Navigate can send an HTTP message to a specified URL and display the results or simply display the results of a specified file. 
&nbsp;
URL specifies the UNC path name of a file or the Uniform Resource Locator of an Internet resource that the Web browser should display. Headers contains any headers sent to the servers when the URL represents an HTTP URL. HTTP headers specify such things as the intended action required of the server, the type of data, and so on. PostData contains the data sent to the server when using Navigate to generate an HTTP POST message. If PostData is NULL, Navigate generates an HTTP GET message. PostData is ignored if URL does not specify an HTTP URL.



Repaint

Call Repaint to repaint the entire control.



SetFocus

Gives the input focus to the control. When a control has focus, it receives keyboard events.

Events of TWebBrowser
&nbsp;


Name

Description



BeforeNavigate

Occurs immediately before the Web browser navigates to a new resource. 
Write an OnBeforeNavigate event handler to redirect or cancel a change to a different URL. This event may occur as the result of a call to the Navigate method, or the user clicking a link.



NavigateComplete

Occurs immediately after the Web browser successfully navigates to a new location. 
Write an OnNavigateComplete event handler to take specific action when the Web browser successfully navigates to a new resource. The event can occur before the document is fully downloaded, but when it occurs at least part of the document must be received and a viewer for the document created.



OnEnter

Occurs when the control receives the input focus. Use the OnEnter event handler to cause any special processing to occur when a control becomes active.



OnExit

Occurs when the input focus shifts away from the control to another control. Use the OnExit event handler to provide special processing when the control ceases to be active.

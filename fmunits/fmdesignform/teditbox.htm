Description 
Use a TEditBox object to put an edit control on a form. Edit controls are used to display and retrieve data that users type. TEditBox permits only a single line of text. If you want the control to contain text that would require multiple lines, consider using a TMemo object. TEditBox uses the Text property to represent the contents of the field. If the control is not associated to a data field, use the Text property to read or specify the text value that appears within the control. The Text property is only accessible by the script library.

Write an OnDrawItem event handler to draw the items in the dropdown list. An OnDrawItem event handler can add graphic elements to the list items, or replace the list item text by graphics. 
Draw the items on the Canvas using the coordinates provided by the X1,Y1,X2,Y2 parameters.



OnEditButtonClick

Write an OnGetText handler to perform custom processing for the contents of the edit box. The parameter value of DisplayText is False when the edit box enters edit mode, otherwise it is True.

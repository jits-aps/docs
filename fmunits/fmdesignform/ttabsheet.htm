General
TTabSheet is an individual page in a TPageControl object.
&nbsp;
Use TTabSheet to represent a single page in a tabbed page control. Tab sheets are typically referred to as pages. TPageControl maintains an indexed array of its tab sheets in its Pages property. Users can click on a tab to activate the tab sheet. To add a new page to a TPageControl object at design time, right-click the TPageControl object and choose New Page.

Name

Description



BorderWidth

Caption

Specifies a text string that identifies the control to the user.



Constraints

Specifies the size constraints for the control.



Cursor

Specifies the background color of the control.



Enabled

Controls whether the control responds to mouse and keyboard events.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text written on or in the control.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control in pixels.



HelpKeyword

Keyword for control's context-sensitive help topic.



Highlighted

Indicates whether the tab sheet appears highlighted.



Hint

Contains the text string that can appear when the user moves the mouse over the control.



Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



PageControl
Run-time only

Indicates the page control object that contains the tab sheet.
&nbsp;
Read PageControl to gain access to the page control object that uses the tab sheet. The properties and methods of the PageControl object can be used to locate the selected page, iterate through the other pages in the page control, or change the display properties of the tabs.
&nbsp;
Set PageControl to remove the tab sheet from its current page control (if any) and insert it into a new page control.
&nbsp;
Example:
&nbsp;
var
 &nbsp; NewTabSheet: TTabSheet;
begin
 &nbsp; NewTabSheet := TTabSheet.Create;
 &nbsp; NewTabSheet.Caption := 'New Page';
 &nbsp; NewTabSheet.PageControl := MyPageControl;
end;



PageIndex

Indicates the index of the tab sheet in the list of tab sheets maintained by the page control.
&nbsp;
Use PageIndex to determine where the tab sheet sits in its page control. Each tab sheet in a page control is automatically assigned a PageIndex when it is inserted in the page control. The first tab sheet receives a value of 0, the second has a value of 1, and so on. PageIndex values are reassigned if tab sheets are deleted or moved.



ParentFont

Determines where a control looks for its font information.



TabVisible

Specifies whether the tab of the TTabSheet object appears in its TPageControl.
&nbsp;
Use TabVisible to temporarily remove a tab sheet from a page control. When TabVisible is false, the tab does not appear in the page control and its TabIndex property is -1. Setting TabVisible to true allows the user to see the tab of the tab sheet again.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Top

Specifies the Y coordinate of the top left corner of a control, relative to its parent or containing control in pixels.



Width

Specifies the horizontal size of the control in pixels.

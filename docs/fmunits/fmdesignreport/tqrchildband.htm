General
Use the TQRChildBand component to create a band that sticks to the bottom of another band. This is useful if you want some controls to move down depending on the vertical expansion of some other controls. Place the expanding controls on one band and put any controls that should move down on a Child band. 
&nbsp;
If you want to make sure the two bands always print on the same page use the LinkBand property to connect them.
The easiest way to add a child band is via the Design Menu. Right click on the band who need a child band, and select Has Child.

Name

Description



AlignToBottom

Use AlignToBottom to force a band to print at the bottom of a page instead of at the top. QuickReport will leave room for a page footer band if such exists. If this property is True for a detail band the effect will be that only one detail band is printed per page.



Color

This sets the background color. Use the Font properties to change text color.



Enabled

Determines whether the component appear at runtime.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text in the band.
If this is not set it defaults to the parentâs font. The band font may be overridden by setting text control properties



ForceNewColumn

If true, the band will always start a new column (this will be a new page in single column reports)
Useful for making reports with many summaries more readable.



ForceNewPage

If true, the band will always start on a new page. Useful for placing summaries at the top of pages.

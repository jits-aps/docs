Description
TIcon is an encapsulation of a Windows icon. Assign an icon to objects that have an Icon property, such as TForm or TPicture. 
Icon objects represent the value loaded from a Windows icon file (.ICO file). Draw an icon on a canvas, using the Draw method of the TCanvas object. Icons do not stretch, so do not use StretchDraw (TCanvas) with an icon.
&nbsp;
Note! &nbsp;TIcon can be used to display the value of a multi-resolution (&gt;16 color) icon. However, it can not support the creation of multi-resolution icons, nor the resizing of the image after it is loaded from a file or stream.

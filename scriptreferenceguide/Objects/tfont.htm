Properties of TFont
&nbsp;


Name

Description



CharSet

Specifies the character set of the font.



Color

Specifies the color of the text.



Height

Specifies the height of the font.



Name

Identifies the typeface of the font. Use Name to specify the typeface of the font. If the font family described by Name includes multiple character sets, be sure to set the Charset property as well. 
Note! If the combination of font family (typeface) and attributes (such as bold or italic) specifies a font that is not available on the system, the system substitutes a different font.



Orientation

Specifies text orientation.



Pitch

Specifies whether the characters in the font all have the same width. 
&nbsp;
Each typeface has an associated pitch. The characters in fixed-pitch fonts are all the same width. The characters in variable-pitch fonts differ in width. Fixed pitch fonts are generally used for representing source code, because they allow the indentation to line up properly. Variable pitch fonts are generally used to give text a more natural appearance 
&nbsp;
Here are the possible values for Pitch: 


Value

Description



fpDefault

The font pitch is set to the default value, which depends on the font specified in the Name property.



fpFixed

The font pitch is set to Fixed. All characters in the font have the same width.



fpVariable

The font pitch is set to Variable. The characters in the font have varying widths.







Quality

Specifies the font quality. 
&nbsp;
Here are the possible values for quality:


Value

Description



fqDefault 

The quality is determined by the system settings. 



fqDraft

For raster fonts, scaling is enabled; the font size can be increased but the quality may be lower. Also the font supports Bold, Italic, Underline or Strikeout if necessary. The quality is less important than when Proof is used. 



fqProof

The quality of the characters is important, so for the raster fonts, scaling is disabled and the font closest in size is chosen. 



fqNonAntialiased

The font is never antialiased.



fqAntialiased

The font is always antialiased if it supports it. The size of the font cannot be too small or too large.



fqClearType

The font is rendered using the ClearType antialiasing method.



fqClearTypeNatural

The font is rendered using the ClearTypeNatural antialiasing method.







Size

Specifies the height of the font in points.



Style

Determines whether the font is normal, italic, underlined, bold, and so on. 
&nbsp;
Use Style to add special characteristics to characters that use the font. Style is a set containing zero or more values from the following:


Value

Description



fsBold

The font is boldfaced.



fsItalic

The font is italicized.



fsUnderline

The font is underlined.



fsStrikeOut

The font is displayed with a horizontal line through it.




&nbsp;
How to change til Style at runtime:
&nbsp;
Label1.Font.Style := 0; // Clear the style
Label1.Font.Style := fsBold + fsUnderline

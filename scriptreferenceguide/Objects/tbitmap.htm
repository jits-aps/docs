Description
A bitmap is a powerful graphics object used to create, manipulate (scale, scroll, rotate, and paint), and store images in memory and as files on a disk.
&nbsp;
TBitmap contains an internal image of the bitmap graphic and automatically manages realization of the palette when drawn. 
To draw a bitmap on a canvas, call the Draw or StretchDraw methods of a TCanvas object, passing a TBitmap as a parameter.
&nbsp;
Creating copies of a TBitmap is very fast since the handle is copied rather than the image. If the image is modified and the handle is shared by more than one TBitmap object, the image is copied before the modification is performed (that is, copy on write).

Description
TPicture contains a bitmap, icon, metafile graphic, or user-defined graphic. 
&nbsp;
TPicture is a TGraphic container, used to hold a graphic, the type of which is specified in the Graphic property. It is used in place of a TGraphic if the graphic can be of any TGraphic class. LoadFromFile and SaveToFile are polymorphic. For example, if the TPicture is holding an Icon, it is valid to LoadFromFile a bitmap file, where the class TIcon can only read .ICO files. 
&nbsp;
If the TPicture contains a bitmap graphic, the Bitmap property specifies the graphic. If the TPicture contains an icon graphic, the Icon property specifies the graphic. If the TPicture contains a metafile graphic, the Metafile property specifies the graphic. 
&nbsp;
The properties of TPicture indicate the type of graphic that the picture object contains, and its size. The methods of TPicture are used to load, save, and manipulate graphics. 
&nbsp;
To draw a picture on a canvas, call the Draw or StretchDraw methods of a TCanvas object, passing the Graphic property of a TPicture as a parameter. 
&nbsp;
Example
&nbsp;
var
 &nbsp;pic: TPicture;
begin
 &nbsp; pic := TPicture.Create;
 &nbsp; with TOpenDialog.Create do
 &nbsp; &nbsp; try
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PictureDialog := True;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if Execute then
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; begin
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pic.LoadFromFile(FileName);
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Image1.Picture.Assign(pic);
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; end;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; finally
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Free;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pic.Free;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; end;
end;

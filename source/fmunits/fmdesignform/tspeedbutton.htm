General 
Use TSpeedButton to execute standard actions, specified by the ButtonKind property. If you are not using an action to respond when the user clicks the button, then you can specify the button's response by writing an OnClick event handler.
&nbsp;
TSpeedButton introduces properties that can be used to set graphical images that represent the different button states (selected, unselected, disabled and so on). Use other properties to specify multiple images or to rearrange the images and text on the button. TSpeedButton also introduces properties that allow speed buttons to work together as a group. Speed buttons are commonly grouped in panels to create specialized tool bars and tool palettes.
&nbsp;
Note! &nbsp;To create a speed button with a client-aligned glyph that covers the button's edges, add a 1-pixel margin around the button's top and left edges and a 3-pixel margin around its bottom and right edges. Do this by manually editing the bitmap specified by the Glyph property.

Caption

Specifies the caption, or label, that appears on the speed button.



Constraints

Specifies the size constraints for the control.



Cursor

Specifies the image used to represent the mouse pointer when it passes into the region covered by the control. 



DataField

Use the property to specify a data field, which values will be used as default value, when ButtonKind is bkNewMail,bkNewSMS or bkHyperlink.



Down

Specifies whether the button is selected (down) or unselected (up).
&nbsp;
When GroupIndex is greater than 0, set Down to true to select a button. When the user clicks on a button in the unselected (up) state, the button is selected and Down is set to true. When the user clicks on a button in the selected (down) state, if Caption is true, the button becomes unselected and Down is set to false.
&nbsp;
At design time, specify which button in a group is the initially selected button by setting the Down property of the selected button to true.
&nbsp;
Note!  When GroupIndex is 0, buttons do not remain in the selected state when clicked. 



Enabled

Controls whether the control responds to mouse clicks.



Flat

Determines whether the button has a 3D border that provides a raised or lowered look.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text written on or in the control.



GroupIndex

Allows speed buttons to work together as a group.
&nbsp;
When GroupIndex is 0, the button behaves independently of all other buttons on the form. When the user clicks such a speed button, the button appears pressed (in its clicked state) and then returns to its normal up state when the user releases the mouse button.
&nbsp;
When GroupIndex is greater than 0, the button remains selected (in its down state) when clicked by the user. When the user clicks a selected button, it returns to the up state, unless Caption is false. Setting the GroupIndex property of a single speed button to a value greater than 0 causes the button to behave as a two-state button when Caption is true.
&nbsp;
Speed buttons with the same GroupIndex property value (other than 0), work together as a group. When the user clicks one of these buttons, it remains selected until the user clicks another speed button belonging to the same group. Speed buttons used in this way can present mutually exclusive choices to the user.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control in pixels.



HelpKeyword

Keyword for control's context-sensitive help topic.



Hint

Contains the text string that can appear when the user moves the mouse over the control.



Image
ImageDisabled

Specifies the image that appears on the button as an icon.
Bring up the Open dialog box from the Object Inspector to choose a picture, or specify a picture at runtime. It is recommended to use bitmaps (.bmp) or Portable Network Graphics (.png).
&nbsp;
Note! The lower left pixel of the bitmap is reserved for the &quot;transparent&quot; color. Any pixel in the bitmap that matches the lower left pixel will be transparent.



KeyValue

Specifies a key value, which will be used when ButtonKind is bkKeyPress.



Layout

Determines where the image or text appears on the speed button.



Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Margin

Specifies the number of pixels between the edge of the button and the image or caption drawn on its surface.

Name

Description



Align

Determines how the control aligns within its container (parent control).



Alignment

Controls the horizontal placement of the text within the label.



Anchors

Specifies how the control is anchored to its parent.



AutoSize

Determines whether the size of the label automatically resizes to accommodate the text.



Caption

Use Caption to specify the text string that labels the control.



Color

Specifies the background color of the control.



Cursor

Specifies the image used to represent the mouse pointer when it passes into the region covered by the control.



Enabled

Controls whether the control responds to mouse and keyboard events.



FocusControl

Designates a windowed control associated with the label. Set FocusControl to the windowed control that should receive focus when the user presses the accelerator key specified by the label. Specify an accelerator key by preceding a character in the label text with an ampersand (&amp;) and setting the ShowAccelChar property to true.
&nbsp;
Note! If Caption is empty and FocusControl is linked to a TEditBox component with is linked to a data field, the label will automatically display the field label, specified by the TField DisplayLabel property.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text written on or in the control.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control in pixels.



HelpKeyword

Keyword for control's context-sensitive help topic.



Hint

Contains the text string that can appear when the user moves the mouse over the control.



Layout

Specifies the vertical placement of the text within the label. Set Layout to specify how the text of the label is placed within the ClientRect of the label control. Layout is the vertical analog to the Alignment property.



Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



ParentColor

Determines where a control looks for its color information.



ParentFont

Determines where a control looks for its font information.



ShowAccelChar

Determines how an ampersand in the label text is displayed.
&nbsp;
Set ShowAccelChar to true to allow the label to display an underlined accelerator key value. When ShowAccelChar is true, any character preceded by an ampersand (&amp;) appears underlined. If the FocusControl property is set, the windowed control specified by the FocusControl property receives input focus when the user types that underlined character. To display an ampersand when ShowAccelChar is true, use two ampersands (&amp;&amp;) to stand for the single ampersand that is displayed.
&nbsp;
Set ShowAccelChar to false to display the label text with all ampersands appearing as ampersands. When ShowAccelChar is false, the value of the FocusControl property is not used.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Top

Specifies the Y coordinate of the top left corner of a control, relative to its parent or containing control in pixels.



Transparent

Specifies whether controls that sit below the label on a form can be seen through the label.



Underline

Determines whether a line at the bottom of the label area will be displayed.



Visible

Determines whether the component appears on screen.



Width

Specifies the horizontal size of the control or form in pixels.



WordWrap

Specifies whether the label text wraps when it is too long for the width of the label.
&nbsp;
Set WordWrap to true to allow the label to display multiple line of text. When WordWrap is true, text that is too wide for the label control wraps at the right margin and continues in additional lines.
&nbsp;
Set WordWrap to false to limit the label to a single line. When WordWrap is false, text that is too wide for the label appears truncated.

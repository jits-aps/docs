Properties of TQRLoopBand
&nbsp;


Name

Description



AlignToBottom

Use AlignToBottom to force a band to print at the bottom of a page instead of at the top. QuickReport will leave room for a page footer band if such exists. If this property is True for a detail band the effect will be that only one detail band is printed per page.



Color

This sets the background color. Use the Font properties to change text color.



Enabled

Determines whether the component appear at runtime.



Font

Contains a TFont object and specifies the attributes of text in the band.
If this is not set it defaults to the parentâs font. The band font may be overridden by setting text control properties.



ForceNewColumn

If true, the band will always start a new column (this will be a new page in single column reports)
Useful for making reports with many summaries more readable.



ForceNewPage

If true, the band will always start on a new page. Useful for placing summaries at the top of pages.



Frame

&lt;description missing&gt;



HasChild

Use this property to create a child band witch will be placed automatically below its parent and associated with it via the âparentâ property.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control in pixels.



KeepOnOnePage

This will stop the band breaking across a page boundary. If the band grows to be bigger than an entire page, it will break, and force this option to false.



Left

Is controlled by the report designer and has no effect.



LinkBand

Linked bands will always print together. That is, they will not be separated by page breaks. In practice, a copy of the linked band is always made before this is printed.

Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



Top

Is controlled by the report designer and has no effect.



TransparentBand

General
The TQRChart component is accessible by the Design Palette and display graphs.
&nbsp;
TQRChart is a âwrapperâ component who gives access to the TeeChart component from Steema Software. Use the Chart Editor to define display characteritics for the Chart and to add Data Series. At design time, double click on the TQRChart component to bring up the editor. Data Series for the TChart component must be populated by code.
&nbsp;
Configuring data Series
After you have dropped a TQRChart component on a report band and added a Series to it, you are ready to populate the Series.
&nbsp;
Example Pie-Series
Suppose the Series we added was a Pie Series. We could populate the Series in the following way:
&nbsp;
procedure ReportBeforeRun(Sender: TObject);
begin
 &nbsp; with QRChart1.SeriesList[0] do
 &nbsp; begin
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Add(40,'Pencil',clRed);
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Add(60,'Paper',clBlue);
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Add(30,'Ribbon',clGreen);
 &nbsp; end;
end;

Properties of TQRChart
&nbsp;


Name

Description



Enabled

Determines whether the component appear at runtime.



Frame

All text components can display a visible frame around them. This property controls the appearance of the frame, which sides it is drawn on and so on.



Height

Specifies the vertical size of the control.



Left

Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the left edge of a component relative to its parent.



Monochrome

The Monochrome property will allow Charts to be draw using only black and white colors. It's not yet completely implemented. Right now it uses the internal Bitmap.Monochrome property, and the output quality isn't really good.



Name

Specifies the name of the component as referenced in code.



SeriesList
Run-time only

The SeriesList property is an array property that contains a list of pointers to all Series linked to a TChart component.Use the SeriesList to populate the data at runtime by code.
&nbsp;
Warning! Never FREE or REMOVE SeriesList elements. Use the Series.Free to remove it or use the Series.Active property to disable it.



ShowAxis

Determines whether the Chart Axis will be displayed or not.



ShowLegend

Determines whether the Chart Legend will be displayed or not.



ShowTitle

Determines whether the Chart Title or Foot will be displayed or not. When False, Chart dimensions grow to fit all available space.



ShowWalls

Determines whether the Chart Walls will be displayed or not.



Size

All printable components share the Size property. You can use this property to set the exact size of the component. This property also contains the position of the component relative to its parent band.



Tag

Stores an integer value as part of a component.
This property is provided for the convenience of developers and has no predefined meaning.



TeePrintMethod

The TeePrintMethod property allows two operation modes:
&nbsp;


Option

Description



qtmBitmap

This mode outputs Charts as bitmap pictures. This makes the Chart appear as it looks on the screen, but remember that bitmaps are larger and slower to print.



qtmMetafile

This mode is faster and gives much better output quality than bitmaps. Chart contents are sent to QuickReports in Windows metafile vector instructions. There are, however, some limitations and bugs in the Windows metafile subsystem.




Clipping does not work fine as it uses physical pixel coordinates instead of logical. Rotated fonts dimensions are very difficult to calculate in metafile mode. This makes rotated fonts overlap or leave too much space on axis and titles.



TitleText

This property is a standard TStringList object and contains the text to be drawn at Top Chart side.



Top

Specifies the Y coordinate of the top left corner of a control, relative to its parent or containing control in pixels.



Width

Specifies the horizontal size of the control.
